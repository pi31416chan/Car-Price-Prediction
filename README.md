# Car Price Prediction
A self-learning machine learning exercise about predicting the car price given car specs.

## Models Trained:
1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. Lasso Regression
4. Ridge + Lasso Regression
5. Polynomial Regression (Linear/Ridge/Lasso/Ridge+Lasso)
6. Support Vector Regression
7. Random Forest Regression
8. K-Nearest Neighbors Regression

## Conclusion:
After testing for several kinds of regression models, the best model appears to be a Ridge(0.2) + Lasso(0.8) mixed regression model after polynomial transforming the X dataset.\
**Scores (Test)**:\
R2: 0.8904\
RMSE: 2682.9644
